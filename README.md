# BNU StockMate â€“ Warehouse Management System

A console-based Warehouse Management System (WMS) developed for BNU Industry Solutions Ltd. This application helps manage suppliers, inventory, customer orders, and financial records using object-oriented design principles.

## Overview

The system features:
- Supplier and customer management
- Purchase and customer order processing
- Inventory tracking with low-stock alerts
- Basic financial reporting (income, expenses, net profit)

## Requirements

- Visual Studio - if you configre VS to work with desktop applications then it _should_ work without installing the .net6 SDK - a link below points to the SDK incase it doesn't work.
- If you wish to run this from VSCode, then you will likely need to install the .net 6 SDK.
- Note: I chose .net 6 as whilst it our "out-of-support" its the most widely available version.
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Running the Application
A pre-built self-contained executable is available in the `../Publish` directory.
